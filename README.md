# Smart Home Automation with Decorator + Facade

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Smart Home Automation System** built in **Java**, utilizing two key design patterns:
- **Decorator Pattern** – for dynamically adding functionalities (e.g., dimming lights, adjusting music volume).
- **Facade Pattern** – to provide a simple interface for controlling multiple smart devices.

The program allows users to:
- Turn **lights** on or off
- Adjust **music system volume**
- Manage **thermostat temperature**
- Enable or disable **security cameras**  
  All interactions occur through a **console-based dialog interface**.
